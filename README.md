# CipherGateway: Secure Data Transmission and Encryption

CipherGateway is a robust and versatile TypeScript-based application designed to facilitate secure data transmission and robust encryption across various network environments. It provides a centralized point for encrypting, decrypting, and routing data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

CipherGateway addresses the growing need for enhanced security in modern applications. It allows developers to implement end-to-end encryption without directly embedding complex cryptographic logic within their core application code. By centralizing these operations, CipherGateway simplifies security management, reduces the risk of vulnerabilities, and provides a unified interface for handling sensitive data. This approach allows for easier compliance with industry standards and regulations that require strong data protection measures. The flexibility of CipherGateway allows it to integrate with diverse systems and protocols.

This gateway acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, intercepting data, applying encryption algorithms, and forwarding it securely. On the receiving end, it decrypts the data before delivering it to the intended recipient. This architecture enables secure communication even over potentially insecure networks. Key management is a central focus of CipherGateway. While this initial version might require manual key distribution for simplicity, future iterations will include features for automated key exchange and rotation, further enhancing security and reducing administrative overhead.

CipherGateway offers several advantages over traditional encryption methods. It reduces the complexity of incorporating encryption into existing applications. It provides a central point for managing encryption keys and configurations. It allows for the implementation of different encryption algorithms without modifying the core application code. It improves the overall security posture of applications by protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit. Its modular design facilitates easy integration with various systems and protocols, making it a valuable asset for organizations seeking to enhance their data security.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Encryption/Decryption Pipeline:** CipherGateway utilizes a configurable pipeline architecture allowing for the integration of various encryption and decryption algorithms. Each stage can be customized or replaced, providing flexibility for different security requirements.
*   **Configurable Routing Rules:** The gateway supports advanced routing rules based on various criteria such as source IP address, destination port, or data content. This allows for granular control over the flow of encrypted data, ensuring only authorized systems can access sensitive information.
*   **Asymmetric and Symmetric Encryption Support:** CipherGateway supports both asymmetric (e.g., RSA, ECC) and symmetric (e.g., AES, ChaCha20) encryption algorithms, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their specific use case. Key management is handled through external configuration, providing flexibility for different key storage solutions.
*   **Audit Logging:** All encryption, decryption, and routing operations are logged with detailed timestamps and user information. This provides a comprehensive audit trail for security monitoring and incident response. The logging level can be adjusted to minimize performance impact while maintaining adequate security visibility.
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** Written in TypeScript, CipherGateway leverages static typing and object-oriented principles for improved code maintainability and reduced runtime errors. This ensures stability and reliability in production environments.
*   **REST API Interface:** A comprehensive REST API enables programmatic control over the gateway's configuration and operation. This allows for seamless integration with existing monitoring and management systems. The API uses JSON for data exchange and follows RESTful principles for easy integration.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** Primary programming language providing static typing for improved code quality and maintainability. TypeScript enhances JavaScript's capabilities, making it suitable for building complex and robust applications.
*   **Node.js:** Runtime environment for executing TypeScript code on the server-side. Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, enabling efficient handling of concurrent requests.
*   **Express.js:** Web application framework for building the REST API and managing routing logic. Express.js simplifies the process of creating robust and scalable web applications.
*   **Crypto:** Node.js built-in module for cryptographic functions, including encryption, decryption, and hashing. The crypto module provides a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and utilities.
*   **Winston:** Logging library for generating detailed audit trails and debugging information. Winston provides flexible logging configurations and supports various output formats.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm installed on your system.
    You can download Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the CipherGateway repository from GitHub:
    `git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/CipherGateway.git`

3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Change your current directory to the cloned repository:
    `cd CipherGateway`

4.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required npm packages:
    `npm install`

5.  **Build the Project:** Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript:
    `npm run build`

## Configuration

CipherGateway relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the following variables:

*   `PORT`: The port number on which the gateway will listen for incoming requests (default: 3000).
*   `ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM`: The encryption algorithm to be used (e.g., AES-256-CBC, RSA).
*   `KEY_FILE`: Path to the file containing the encryption key.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., info, warn, error).

Example `.env` file:

PORT=3000
ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM=AES-256-CBC
KEY_FILE=/path/to/your/key.pem
LOG_LEVEL=info

## Usage

1.  **Start the Gateway:** Run the compiled JavaScript code to start the CipherGateway:
    `npm start`

2.  **REST API:** The gateway exposes a REST API for managing encryption and decryption operations.

    *   **Encrypt Data:**
        `POST /encrypt`
        Request Body:
        `{ "data": "Sensitive data to be encrypted" }`
        Response:
        `{ "encryptedData": "The encrypted data" }`

    *   **Decrypt Data:**
        `POST /decrypt`
        Request Body:
        `{ "encryptedData": "The data to be decrypted" }`
        Response:
        `{ "data": "The decrypted data" }`

3.  **Key Management:** For symmetric encryption algorithms, ensure the key is securely generated and distributed. For asymmetric encryption, manage the private and public keys appropriately.
